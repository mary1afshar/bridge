# how it works

It's easy as 1 2 3, first create an account on Bridge+ which will ask for your name, pronouns, university, occupation, interest, and location. Based on this information, our application will show you a variety of women near you. You can select based on the information you see to connect with the women by swiping right, or left to go back to the previous profile. Once clicking on the heart, you will be able to send messages, book a coffee chat, and build a relationship. This platform aims to not only provide an opportunity to build your network but also mentorship and friendship if that is what you are looking for!
